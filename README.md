## 🧪 VulnVault Self-Directed Independent Lab

**Status:** Self-researched, self-setup vulnerable web application lab (Flask-based,
localhost:5000)

This section documents **independent achievement** in cybersecurity hands-on work. All VulnVault
material is the result of self-directed learning—no platform guidance, no tutorials—deploying a
vulnerable application locally and systematically discovering, understanding, and exploiting
web security vulnerabilities through practical attack methodology.

### Independent Lab Work

**Application Setup & Deployment:**
- Independently deployed vulnerable Flask web application (VulnVault)
- Configured local environment for secure testing
- Identified attack surfaces through enumeration
- Developed exploitation methodology for multiple vulnerability classes

### Skills Mastered (Self-Directed Learning)

**Web Application Enumeration:**
- Manual reconnaissance using browser DevTools and Network analysis
- Automated directory/file discovery with Gobuster
- API endpoint identification and parameter mapping
- Technology stack fingerprinting
- Information disclosure from error messages and HTTP headers

**Web Security Vulnerability Exploitation:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Reflected, Stored, DOM-based attack vectors
- SQL Injection: Authentication bypass, data extraction, database enumeration
- File Upload vulnerabilities: Validation bypass, web shell deployment
- Remote Code Execution: Post-shell system access and privilege escalation

**Offensive Methodology:**
- Burp Suite Community: Request interception, parameter testing, response analysis
- Payload construction and filter bypass techniques
- Post-exploitation information gathering and data exfiltration
- Understanding attacker perspective vs defensive controls
